White light splitting into colors of the visible spectrum when shone through a prism is an example of light displaying wave-like character.  The photoelectric effect, where a photon of light with energy $h\\nu$ collides with an electron causing it to leave the metal if the incident energy is larger than the work function, is an example of light displaying matter-like character.  In 1925, de Broglie reasoned that both light and matter display this behavior.  Whats more, the realatonship between wavelength and momentum derived for light by Einstein also applies to matter\n",
