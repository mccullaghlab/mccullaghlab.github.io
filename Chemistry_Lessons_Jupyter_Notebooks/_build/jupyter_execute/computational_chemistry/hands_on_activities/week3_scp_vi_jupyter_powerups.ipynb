    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you will practice three skills you will use repeatedly in computational chemistry workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transferring files to/from the HPC system** (`pete.hpc.okstate.edu`) using `scp` (and **WinSCP** for Windows users)\n",
    "2. A **crash course in `vi`** (the editor you will see on HPC systems)\n",
    "3. A few **advanced Jupyter/Python** habits (functions, re-running cells safely, and simple organization)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **End-of-class deliverable:** a small set of files in your HPC directory plus brief evidence pasted into this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `scp` to copy files **to** and **from** `pete.hpc.okstate.edu`\n",
    "- Explain the difference between a *local machine path* and a *remote path*\n",
    "- Use `vi` to create and edit a text file (insert mode, save, quit, search)\n",
    "- Write a simple Python function in a notebook and use it to compute values repeatedly\n",
    "- Keep a notebook reproducible (restart kernel, run-all, avoid hidden state)\n"
