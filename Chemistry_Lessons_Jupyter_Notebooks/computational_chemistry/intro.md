Computational Chemistry
============================
In these notes, I will introduce the theoretical foundations and practical tools
used to model molecular systems. The course begins with quantum mechanical methods for computing
molecular structure and energies, including the Schrödinger equation, variational approaches,
Hartree--Fock theory, and basis sets. These ideas motivate the development of classical force
fields and molecular mechanics models, followed by an introduction to statistical ensembles and
their role in connecting microscopic behavior to macroscopic observables.

The second half of the notes focuses on molecular dynamics simulations in gas and condensed
phases, with an emphasis on interpreting trajectories, evaluating sampling quality, and
extracting structural and thermodynamic information. Weekly hands-on exercises using Linux,
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, WebMO/Gaussian, Amber, and MDAnalysis provide students with practical
experience running calculations, analyzing results, and automating workflows. The course ends
with a short independent project applying these methods to a chemical or biochemical system.
