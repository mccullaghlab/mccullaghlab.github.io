    "How do we study systems we cannot directly observe? We build models and test how those models work.  Maps and weather forecasts, for examples, are models of systems or processes of which we cannot make a complete, direct observation.  In Chemistry, we cannot directly observe atoms and molecules and thus must make inferences, construct models, and test the limitations of these models. "
